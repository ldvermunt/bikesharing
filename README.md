## Overview
In this project Tableau is implimented to generate a series of charts which are designed to inform users about Citibike, a rideshare bicycle company.  Their customer information has been imported to tableau regarding bicycle usage and displayed to showcase how this usage is affected by times of the day, days of the week, and rider gender.  A prospective startup might generate a similar data set to help determine viability for a similar company in a different market.

## The Data

### How is Ridership Affected by Day of the Week and Time of Day?

This Graphic helps to illustrate the high ridership days of the week and times of the day.  It shows us that ridership is the highest during the weekday commute hours, as well as during the weekends during daylight hours.  The early mornings show very sparse useage, perhaps a good time to do routine maintenance.

### How Long is a Typical Rental For?  Is it Changed by a Users Gender?

This set of charts displays the number of users and how long their rental was for.  It further breaks down those numbers along gender lines.  The vast majority of users are riding for two to fifteen minutes, numbers that dont chage between genders.  The original challenge chart included a second and third hour of data, but it was not useful due to no one renting for these extended periods of time.  A further improvement would be to eliminate the "UNKNOWN" calculation of gender because the numbers are so small they follow the same trend as the "MALE and "FEMALE" indicators.  This information could be used for marketing purposes, as well as setting pricing levels for rental time.

### How Many Trips Are Taken By Gender For Day and Time?

This chart is illustrative of how gender affects the usage by day and time.  The previously established trends are reinforced here by showing heavy usage during commutes, as well as some weekend activity during the day.  Gender is only a factor so far as male usage is higher.

### Is Usage Different Among Subscribers to the Service vs One Time Customers

Here we can see that the majority of use is generated through a subscribership program.  Single users, while present, represent a significant minority of the data.  This information leads one to believe that a subscriber program is a must if starting such a business.  Subscribers may also submit more personal data depending on the membership sign up process, which can help to determine the best locations for units.

## How To Improve This Data
 - Whenever the "UNKNOWN" group is represented in the data a large chunk of visual real-eatate is taken up with little return to the end user.  This data it appears could be either eliminated, or in my opinion, safely rolled into male and female categories at the correct ratio without affecting the data negatively.
 - More information regarding the users age would have been easy to compile and may help with marketing.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111530580/204841184-fe3b8e10-3c1d-4da2-8800-cb42f9b0f166.png)

 - The locations of the trips while not directly applicable to someone starting a business in a new market can also be of interest, as it would help reinforce the notion that commuters are the main driver of the business. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111530580/204841436-ed06c2a5-c7ab-49e6-b0d1-2addda308cda.png)

## Summary
This data helps the user to determine some courses of action for starting a bike rideshare business in a different market.  Of additional interest would be information reagarding the usage by time of year.  One would imagine winter being a slower time due to the weather.  Planning for swings in business activity coudl be important for the client.  Also, data that gauges customer interest in a new market could be visualized as well.  A survey taken in their market could prove useful in determining how best to impliment their ideas.
