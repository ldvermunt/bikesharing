# Bikesharing Tableau Project
## Overview
In this project Tableau is implimented to generate a series of charts which are designed to inform users about Citibike, a rideshare bicycle company.  Their customer information has been imported to tableau regarding bicycle usage and displayed to showcase how this usage is affected by times of the day, days of the week, and rider gender.  A prospective startup might generate a similar data set to help determine viability for a similar company in a different market.  A link to the Tableau Public 

## The Data

### How is Ridership Affected by Day of the Week and Time of Day?

This Graphic helps to illustrate the high ridership days of the week and times of the day.  It shows us that ridership is the highest during the weekday commute hours, as well as during the weekends during daylight hours.  The early mornings show very sparse useage, perhaps a good time to do routine maintenance.
### How Long is a Typical Rental For?  Is it Changed by a Users Gender?
